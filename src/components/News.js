                    <p className="mb-6">
                    Kung Fu Panda 4, which will be released in 2024, marks Angelina Jolie's biggest box office hit since Kung Fu Panda 3 in 2016. Given how well the third installment in the Kung Fu Panda franchise performed at the box office, the fourth film will undoubtedly be just as successful. In fact, it may even outdo the third film due to the 8-year gap, and because the franchise, like Shrek, Toy Story, or How to Train Your Dragon is a beloved series of animated films that have been going strong for over a decade.

                    <p className="mb-6">
                    Between Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 3, Jolie's character, Tigress, also appeared in shorter videos and holiday specials like Kung Fu Panda Holiday, Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Masters, and Kung Fu Panda Po's Winter Wonderland. These smaller spinoffs kept the franchise alive in fans' minds but also made it ubiquitous, whereas releasing a new film all these years later will make it feel special. Jolie is rejoined by the original cast including Jack Black as Po, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and Dustin Hoffman as Rat.
